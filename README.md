# Libft - a custom library of standard C functions

This project is the first of Hive / 42 network curriculum.

The objective is to implement own versions of standard C functions (think: atoi, itoa, strlen, strcmp, memset, strdup, calloc, substr, strjoin).

It is also the beginning of my journey with linked lists (eg. lstsize, lstadd_front, lstclear, lstiter), as well as my first real attempt at a Makefile.

## The repository contains:
-Makefile

-libft.h

-bonus functions (linked list-related)

-overflow checks in atoi and calloc

## Info for fellow students:
My implementations did pass the Moulinette, at 125/100 points.
